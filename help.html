                <h3>Why is the loan amount very low ? How can I increase it ?</h3>
                <p>
                    At first, your limit will be low since you're a new Kashat customer with no historical credit transactions, but by time when you start paying back on time and building strong historical transactions, your credit score will increase and hence your loan limits will be higher.</p>
